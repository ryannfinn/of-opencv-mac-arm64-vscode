# Installing OpenCV C++ on an arm64 Mac for OpenFrameworks and VSCode

This is just to document my journey for installing native OpenCV for the use of OpenFrameworks. I've used in total 8 hours for doing that and I found there's no single one tutorial that has the exact setting I'm having. Installing OpenCV is never easy and tons of issues can come up. The [tutorial written by LingDong-] <https://github.com/LingDong-/fast-many-face-detection-with-cpp-or-openframeworks-on-mac-using-neural-networks> and the [official VSCode for OpenFrameworks] <https://openframeworks.cc/setup/vscode/> is the base that I followed through. 

## Getting OpenCV

I have tried two ways of getting OpenCV, one through Homebrew and also through compiling from source like on the [OpenCV website] <>.

- path issue
- 
- cmake
- how I found out the problem

## Setting the correct flags and locations on VSCode

## Architecture (x86_64 vs arm64)

I tried to compile from source by using cmake and it failed
